Connect with SSH to your OpenWrt device: $ ssh root@192.168.1.1
Execute uci show wireless to see all the wireless configurations and how many Wi-Fi chips (called “radio” in the config) there are on the device. Identify the radio number (0, 1, 2, etc) that are you aiming to. E.g., radio0, radio1, radio2, radioX.
Find out your country in a list of ISO/IEC 3166 alpha2 country codes. There is a list in the Wikipedia article about ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.
Execute uci set wireless.radioN.country='XX' to set the country code XX for each (N = 0, 1, 2) radio devices your router may have.
Execute uci set wireless.radioN.disabled='0' to enable all the said radio(s).
Commit the changes executing: uci commit wireless.
Reload the wifi interfaces: wifi reload.
Wait a couple of minutes to allow the radio(s) booting and eventually DFS scanning. Enjoy
